## Productivity Analysis

## Scope Grade
### Satisfactory : 45/45
1. Implement internal representation of data base.
2. Achieve storing data in a file on the hard drive so data will be kept after accidental or regular shut down like a real data base managing system.


### Good : 40/40
1. Implement database CRUD operations using the indexing data structure and the internal representation of tree. Right now we have parser and data base tree working on their own separately but not connected to work together yet. Manipulation and filtering of data base is needed to accomplish this.

### Excellent: 15/15
1. Connect the command line interface and the parser to the database to demo database operations easier. We will have the command line to print out the actual representation of the data.

## Goals for the Next Sprint
In MS3 we plan to accomplish the following:
### Satisfactory

### Good

### Excellent
